That's it, I'm going to start blogging and I'm doing it for the following reasons:

1.  There's an opportunity for me to become a better communicator
2.  To document solutions to development problems I've encountered
3.  I've always wanted a reason to use Markdown outside of GitHub

Spelling mistakes are forthcoming.
