About six months ago, I started Designing and Developing for entrepreneur <a href="http://lpmo.com" target="_blank">LP Maurice</a> as a freelancer.  During this time, I had the opportunity to meet some great people and collaborate on a wide array of exciting projects. As these projects come to an end, it's time for me to move on to a new set of challenges.

With that said, I'm delighted to announce that I'm joining <a href="http://busbud.com" target="_blank">Busbud</a> as a **Web Developer and Designer**.

Busbud is a remarkable young company formed of an insanely driven and talented team. It's truly an honour to join the group and I'm really excited to start building alongside them and help shape the future of bus travel.

Busbud is growing and we're currently looking for talented developers. If that sounds like you, head over to our <a href="http://www.busbud.com/en/jobs" target="_blank">jobs</a> page or shoot me a <a href="mailto:hi@naoufal.com?subject=Busbud Jobs" target="_blank">message</a>!
